* Pigeonhole Principle
A pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

For example, of three gloves, at least two must be right-handed or at least two must be left-handed, since there are three objects but only two categories of handedness to put them into.

This might seem very obvious, but this principle can be used to demonstrate some unexpected results. For example, given that the population of London is more than one unit greater than the maximum amount of hairs that can be on a human head, the principle requires that there must be at least two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.
