* Problem 1
** Task
Define R on Z a mRn <--> 2|(m^2 + n^2) for all m,n ∈ Z. Is R an equivalence relation?

** Solution
A relation R is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

* Problem 2 [TRY]
** Task
Let R be a relation on the real numbers defined by xRy <--> x^2 = y^2. Is R an equivalence relation.

** Solution
*** Notes
The equivalence relation should follow the following points:

#+begin_quote
- a~a for all a ∈ Z.
- If a~b, then b~a for all and a,b ∈ Z.
- If a~b and b~c, then a~c for all a,b,c ∈ Z.
#+end_quote

Example:

|---+---+---+---|
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---+---+---+---|
| 1 | T | F | F |
|---+---+---+---|
| 2 | F | T | F |
|---+---+---+---|
| 3 | F | F | T |
|---+---+---+---|
The table does not violate any of the mentioned constraints, as it:
- has a~a for all a ∈ Z.
- does not have a~b, therefore no b~a for all and a,b ∈ Z.
- does not have a~b and b~c, therefore no a~c for all a,b,c ∈ Z.

Therefore, R is an equivalence relation.

**** My wording
- Relation must be reflexive
  Meaning that there should be all a,b ∈ A. (i.e. {(1,1), (2, 2), (3, 3), ...})

- Relation must be symmetric
  Meaning that if there is a (a,b) there should also be (b,a)

- Relation must be transitive
  Meaning that if aRb and bRc, there should be aRc

**** Formal notation
#+begin_quote
- a~a for all a ∈ Z.
- If a~b, then b~a for all and a,b ∈ Z.
- If a~b and b~c, then a~c for all a,b,c ∈ Z.

**** Formal equivalence recreation
#+begin_quote
- a~a for all a ∈ Z.
- If a~b, then b~a for all a,b ∈ Z.
- If a~b and b~c, then a~c for all a,b,c ∈ Z.
