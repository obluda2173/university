** 3.1 Lists
- List :: is an ordered sequence of object. A list is denoted by an opening parenthesis, followed by the obgects, separated by commas, followed by a closing parenthesis. For examle (a, b, c) is a list consisting of the first three letters of the English alphabet in order. The objects a, b, c are called the enries of the list; the first entry is a, and the second is b, and so on. Note:

  (a, b, c, d, e) != {b, a, c, d, e}.
** 3.2 The Mutliplication Principle
#+begin_quote
*Fact 3.1* (Multiplication Principle) Suppose in making a list of length n there are a1 possible chices for the first entry, a2 possible choices for the second entry, a3 possible choices for the third entry and so on. Then the total number of different lists that can be made this way is a1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * ... * an.

*Example 3.1* A standatd license plate consists of three letters followed by four digits. For example, JBR-4412 and MMX-8901 are two standard license plates. How many different standard license plates possible?

*Solution:* A license plate such as JBR-4412 corresponds to a length-7 list (J, B, R, 4, 4, 1, 2), so we just need to count how many such lists are possible. We use the *multiplication principle* There are a1 = 26 possibilities for the first entry of the list. Similarly, there are a2 = 26 possibilities for the second entry, and also third. There are a4 = 10 possibilities for the fourth entry. Likewise a5 = a6 = a7 = 10. So there is a total of a1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * ... * a7 = 26^3 * 10^4 possible standard license plates.

*Example 3.2* In ordering a cafe latte, you have a choice of whole, skim or soy milk; small, medium or large; and either one or two shots of espresso. How many choices do you have in ordering one drink?

*Solution:* a1 = 3, a2 = 3, a3 = 2. Therefore, 3 * 3 * 2 = 18 number of cafe choices.

Notice! there are two types of list-counting problems. On pne hand, there are situations in which list entries can be repeated, as in license plates or telephone numbers. On the other hand, for some lists repeated symbols do not make any sense or are not allowed, as in the list from /Example 3.1/. This kind of list repetition is called non-repetitive lists.

*Example 3.3* Consider lists of length 4 made with symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
1. How many such lists are possible if repetition is allowed?
2. How many such lists are possible if repetition is not allowed?
3. How many are there if repetition is not allowed and the list has an E?
4. How many are there if repetition is allowed and the list has an E?

*Solutions:*
1. List (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) has 7 objects. Thus, 7^4 possibilities.
2. 7 objects, with each new entry being less object options. Therefore, 7! / 3!.
3. Minus 1 object from list, thus 6 options. No repetitions. 6! / 3! * 4.
4. 7^4 - 6^4.
