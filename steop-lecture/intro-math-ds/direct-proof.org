** 4.0 Introduction
- Theorem :: is a mathematical statement that is true and can be (and has been) verified as true.
- Proof :: of a theorem is a written verification that shows that the theorem is definitely and unequivocally true.
- Definition :: is an exact, unambigious explanation of the meaning of a mathematical word or phrase.

** 4.1 Theorems
Examples of theorem:

- *Theorem* - Let f be differentiable on an open interval I and let c âˆˆ I. If f(c) is the maximum or minimum value of f on I, then f(c) = 0.
- *Theorem* - Suppose f is continious on the interval [a, b]. Then f is integrable on [a, b].
- *Theorem* - Every absolutely convergent series converges.

Observe that in each of these theorems either has the conditional form "If P, then Q." or can be put into that form.
