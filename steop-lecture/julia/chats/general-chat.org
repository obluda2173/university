*** How would you advice to learn Julia coding language if I have a strong background in C, CPP, TS, JS and Python?

Here are my recommendations:

1. *Get Familiar with Julia Syntax:* As you're already familiar with several coding languages, learning the basic syntax of Julia should be relatively straightforward. Julia is similar to a simplified, flexible Python programing language but with performance comparable to C. The official Julia documentation is a good place to start learning about Julia's syntax.

2. *Understand Key Julia Concepts:* Once you're comfortable with the syntax, learn about key Julia features that set it apart from other languages you know, like multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, native parallel computing, and support for mathematical and scientific computation driven tasks.

3. *Do Projects:* To accelerate your understanding and get practical experience, think of implementing projects using Julia. This would be a good opportunity to learn how Julia's performance and features solve real-world problems.

4. *Use Online Resources:* There are several learning resources available online such as the Julia Academy and the Learn Julia the Hard Way. Additionally, there are many available Julia packages that you can use.

5. *Join Julia Community:* Participate in Julia user forums and Q&A websites to get help and answers to your questions. Joining the Julia community on GitHub and contributing to open source projects can also be a very helpful step in the learning process.

6. *Comparison with Known Languages:* Since you are proficient with C, C++, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python, compare the similarities and differences with Julia. This strategy can help you to understand and apply concepts in Julia quickly.

7. *Use Jupyter Notebooks:* Just like Python, Julia can be used with Jupyter notebooks. This can be a great tool for experimenting with the language and documenting your learning progress.

Remember, the goal is to understand how Julia can make tasks easier, better, or faster compared to the languages you already know, and how you can leverage these advantages in your projects.
