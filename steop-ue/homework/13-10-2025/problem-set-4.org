* Problem 1
** Task
Let x and y be nonnegative numbers. Prove that if x <= y, then x^(1/2) <= y^(1/2).

** Solution
*Proposition.* If x, y ∊ R; x, y >= 0; x <= y. Then x^(1/2) <= y^(1/2).

*Proof.* Assume x, y ∊ R; x, y >= 0; x <= y.

Let a = x^(1/2), b = y^(1/2). Then a, b >= 0 and a^2 = x <= y = b^2.

Assume for contradiction that a > b. Then, since a, b >= 0,

a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) > 0

Because (a - b) > 0 and (a + b) > 0. That gives a^2 > b^2, i.e. x > y, contradicting x <= y. Hence the assumption is false.

Therefore, x^(1/2) <= y^(1/2). Equality holds iff x = y.

* Problem 2
** Task
For n ∊ N prove that 4|(1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)).

** Solution
*** Induction [atepmt]
*Proposition.* If n ∊ N, then 4|(1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)).

*Basis step.* n = 1. (1 + (-1)^1 * (2 * 1 - 1)) = 0
              n = 2. (1 + (-1)^2 * (2 * 2 - 1)) = 4
              n = 3. (1 + (-1)^3 * (2 * 3 - 1)) = -4
              n = 4. (1 + (-1)^4 * (2 * 4 - 1)) = 8
              n = 5. (1 + (-1)^5 * (2 * 5 - 1)) = -8
              n = 6. (1 + (-1)^6 * (2 * 6 - 1)) = 12

*Inductive hypothesis.* Assume k ∊ N, m ∊ Z, (1 + (-1)^k * (2k - 1)) = 4m.

*Induction step.* (1 + (-1)^(k+1) * (2(k+1) - 1))
                  <--> 1 + (-1)^(k+1) * (2k + 1)
                  <--> 1 + -(-1)^k * (2k + 1)
                  <--> 1 + -(-1)^k * (2k - 1) + 2(-1)^k

*** Parity
n = 1. (1 + (-1)^1 * (2 * 1 - 1)) = 0
n = 2. (1 + (-1)^2 * (2 * 2 - 1)) = 4
n = 3. (1 + (-1)^3 * (2 * 3 - 1)) = -4
n = 4. (1 + (-1)^4 * (2 * 4 - 1)) = 8
n = 5. (1 + (-1)^5 * (2 * 5 - 1)) = -8
n = 6. (1 + (-1)^6 * (2 * 6 - 1)) = 12

If n is even:
        1 + (-1)^(2k) * (2(2k) - 1) = 1 + 1 * (4k - 1) = 4k

If n is odd:
        1 + (-1)^(2k+1) * (2(2k+1) - 1) = 1 - 1 * (4k + 1) = -4k

For both cases of n (1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)) is a multiple of 4.

Hence, for n ∊ N, 4|(1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)).

Q.E.D.

* Problem 3
** Task
Prove that log2(3) is irrational.

** Solution
log2(3) = p / q, where p, q ∊ Z; q > 0.
2^(p / q) = 3
2^p = 3^q

LHS has only one prime factor 2.
RHS has only one prime factor 3.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics (unique prime factorisation), the two sides can not be equal unless both are 1.
But 2^p = 1 would force p = 0, which gives 3^q = 0, and then q = 0, which is impossible because q > 0.

Thus log2(3) is irrational.

* Problem 4
** Task
Five children found nine mushrooms. Prove that at least two of them found an equal number of mushrooms.

** Solution
*** notes
1 - 0 - 0
2 - 1 - 1
3 - 2 - 3
4 - 3 - 6
5 - 4 - 10

If all five children would have different amount of mushrooms, then they could be represented as every next child having n + 1 mushrooms, where n is the number of mushrooms of previous child.

If we start with first child having 0 mushrooms, it would look like:

sum(from x = -1, till n)(x + 1) = 9  (where n is the number of children)

thus n = 3 (+1 since we should count children number 0), thus n = 4

*** Proof by contradiction
*Claim.* Five children found nine mushrooms. Then at least two children found the same number of mushrooms.

*Proof (by contradiction).* Mushroom counts are whole number >= 0. Assume, for contradiction, that all five children found different numbers of mushrooms. Order the counts increasingly:

a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 < a5,  ai ∊ Z, ai >= 0.

Since they are unique integers and >= 0, we must have

a1 >= 0, a2 >= 1, a3 >= 2, a4 >= 3, a5 >= 4.

Hence the total amount of mushrooms is 10, which exceeds the number of found mushrooms (9). Therefore, my statement was false, meaning that at least 2 children had same number of found mushrooms.
