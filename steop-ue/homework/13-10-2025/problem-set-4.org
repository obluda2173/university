* Problem 1
** Task
Let x and y be nonnegative numbers. Prove that if x <= y, then x^(1/2) <= y^(1/2).

** Solution
*Proposition.* If x, y ∊ R; x, y >= 0; x <= y. Then x^(1/2) <= y^(1/2).

*Proof.* Assume x, y ∊ R; x, y >= 0; x <= y.

Let a = x^(1/2), b = y^(1/2). Then a, b >= 0 and a^2 = x <= y = b^2.

Assume for contradiction that a > b. Then, since a, b >= 0,

a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) > 0

Because (a - b) > 0 and (a + b) > 0. That gives a^2 > b^2, i.e. x > y, contradicting x <= y. Hence the assumption is false.

Therefore, x^(1/2) <= y^(1/2). Equality holds iff x = y.

* Problem 2
** Task
For n ∊ N prove that 4|(1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)).

** Solution
*** Induction [atepmt]
*Proposition.* If n ∊ N, then 4|(1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)).

*Basis step.* n = 1. (1 + (-1)^1 * (2 * 1 - 1)) = 0
              n = 2. (1 + (-1)^2 * (2 * 2 - 1)) = 4
              n = 3. (1 + (-1)^3 * (2 * 3 - 1)) = -4
              n = 4. (1 + (-1)^4 * (2 * 4 - 1)) = 8
              n = 5. (1 + (-1)^5 * (2 * 5 - 1)) = -8
              n = 6. (1 + (-1)^6 * (2 * 6 - 1)) = 12

*Inductive hypothesis.* Assume k ∊ N, m ∊ Z, (1 + (-1)^k * (2k - 1)) = 4m.

*Induction step.* (1 + (-1)^(k+1) * (2(k+1) - 1))
                  <--> 1 + (-1)^(k+1) * (2k + 1)
                  <--> 1 + -(-1)^k * (2k + 1)
                  <--> 1 + -(-1)^k * (2k - 1) + 2(-1)^k

*** Parity
n = 1. (1 + (-1)^1 * (2 * 1 - 1)) = 0
n = 2. (1 + (-1)^2 * (2 * 2 - 1)) = 4
n = 3. (1 + (-1)^3 * (2 * 3 - 1)) = -4
n = 4. (1 + (-1)^4 * (2 * 4 - 1)) = 8
n = 5. (1 + (-1)^5 * (2 * 5 - 1)) = -8
n = 6. (1 + (-1)^6 * (2 * 6 - 1)) = 12

If n is even:
        1 + (-1)^(2k) * (2(2k) - 1) = 1 + 1 * (4k - 1) = 4k

If n is odd:
        1 + (-1)^(2k+1) * (2(2k+1) - 1) = 1 - 1 * (4k + 1) = -4k

For both cases of n (1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)) is a multiple of 4.

Hence, for n ∊ N, 4|(1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)).

Q.E.D.

* Problem 3
** Task
Prove that log2(3) is irrational.

** Solution
log2(3) = p / q, where p, q ∊ Z; q > 0.
2^(p / q) = 3
2^p = 3^q

LHS has only one prime factor 2.
RHS has only one prime factor 3.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics (unique prime factorisation), the two sides can not be equal unless both are 1.
But 2^p = 1 would force p = 0, which gives 3^q = 0, and then q = 0, which is impossible because q > 0.

Thus log2(3) is irrational.

* Problem 4
** Task
Five children found nine mushrooms. Prove that at least two of them found an equal number of mushrooms.

** Solution
*** notes
1 - 0 - 0
2 - 1 - 1
3 - 2 - 3
4 - 3 - 6
5 - 4 - 10

If all five children would have different amount of mushrooms, then they could be represented as every next child having n + 1 mushrooms, where n is the number of mushrooms of previous child.

If we start with first child having 0 mushrooms, it would look like:

sum(from x = -1, till n)(x + 1) = 9  (where n is the number of children)

thus n = 3 (+1 since we should count children number 0), thus n = 4

*** Proof by contradiction
*Claim.* Five children found nine mushrooms. Then at least two children found the same number of mushrooms.

*Proof (by contradiction).* Mushroom counts are whole number >= 0. Assume, for contradiction, that all five children found different numbers of mushrooms. Order the counts increasingly:

a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 < a5,  ai ∊ Z, ai >= 0.

Since they are unique integers and >= 0, we must have

a1 >= 0, a2 >= 1, a3 >= 2, a4 >= 3, a5 >= 4.

Hence the total amount of mushrooms is 10, which exceeds the number of found mushrooms (9). Therefore, my statement was false, meaning that at least 2 children had same number of found mushrooms.

* Problem 5
** Task
Calculate
a. 0.1212.. + 0.122122..
b. 0.33.. + 0.44..

** Solution
*** a.
0.1212.. + 0.122122.. = 12/99 + 122/999
lcm(99, 999) = 10989

Thus,
111 * 12/99 + 11 * 122/999 = 1332/10989 + 1342/10989
                           = 2674/10989
                           = 0.243334...
*** b.
0.33.. * 0.44.. = 3/9 * 4/9
                = 12/81
                = 4/27
                = 0.148...

* Problem 6
** Task
Find digits a and b such that (o.aa..)^(1/2) = 0.bb..

** Solution
1. a = 0, b = 0
2. a = 1, b = 3
3. a = 4, b = 6
4. a = 9, b = 9

* Problem 7
** Task

** Solution

* Problem 8
** Task
a. gcd(10223; 33341)
b. gcd(2n + 1; 3n + 2)

** Solution
a. 33341 = 10223 * 3 + 2672
   10223 = 2672 * 3 + 2207
   2672 = 2207 * 1 + 465
   2207 = 465 * 4 + 347
   465 = 347 * 1 + 118
   347 = 118 * 2 + 111
   116 = 111 * 1 + 5
   111 = 5 * 22 + 1
   5 = 1 * 5 + 0

   Thus, 1
b. 1

* Problem 9
** Task
Convert (110 1001 0101 1011)2 to decimal representation. Without converting, can you know for sure whether this number is greater than 2^15?

** Solution
1. 26971
2. Smaller
   - Last digit can represent sign, making number less or equal to 2^14
   - Obviously smaller, since the number is 15 bits long and not the maximum number (since not all bit equal to 1)
