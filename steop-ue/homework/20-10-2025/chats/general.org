*** Below I give you the problem. How exactly should I approach this problem? I don't quite understand the idea behind it, since for me there are lots of unknown factors. Because, how can I know that every boy knows 32 different girls, with no boy knowing any common girl. This leads be to an idea of boys and girls being inside of the possible range, with boys being in ragne of 29 <= b <= 32*29:
In a school, every boy knows 32 girls, and every girl knows 29 boys. Who are there more of in the school: boys or girls, and by how many times?


The problem can be approached using a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of boys by B and the number of girls by G.

From the problem, we know that:

- Every boy knows 32 girls, so the total number of boy-girl pairs is B*32.
- Every girl knows 29 boys, so the total number of boy-girl pairs is also G*29.

So, we have the equation:

B*32 = G*29

Now, we can calculate G/B ratio:

G/B = 32/29

It means there are more girls than boys, and the ratio is 32/29. That is, there are approximately 1.1034 times more girls than boys.
