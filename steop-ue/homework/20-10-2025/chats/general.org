*** Below I give you the problem. How exactly should I approach this problem? I don't quite understand the idea behind it, since for me there are lots of unknown factors. Because, how can I know that every boy knows 32 different girls, with no boy knowing any common girl. This leads be to an idea of boys and girls being inside of the possible range, with boys being in ragne of 29 <= b <= 32*29:
In a school, every boy knows 32 girls, and every girl knows 29 boys. Who are there more of in the school: boys or girls, and by how many times?


The problem can be approached using a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of boys by B and the number of girls by G.

From the problem, we know that:

- Every boy knows 32 girls, so the total number of boy-girl pairs is B*32.
- Every girl knows 29 boys, so the total number of boy-girl pairs is also G*29.

So, we have the equation:

B*32 = G*29

Now, we can calculate G/B ratio:

G/B = 32/29

It means there are more girls than boys, and the ratio is 32/29. That is, there are approximately 1.1034 times more girls than boys.

*** Could you please explain to be the difference between the permutation and choose formulas. Also please explain what exactly does the formulas mean (by explaining why each variable is at its place).

Both the permutation and combination (choose) formulas relate to the counting of subsets in a larger set. They provide ways to calculate the number of possible combinations or arrangements of items.

1. Permutation : This is the number of arrangements from a set of n items taken k at a time, where the order of arrangement matters. It's represented as P(n, k) or sometimes nPk.

   The formula for permutation is: P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!

   - =n!= denotes the /factorial/ of n, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
   - =(n-k)!= is the factorial of the remaining items (n-k) after selecting k items from the set.

   For example, for arranging 3 letters from A, B, C, D: P(4,3) = 4*3*2 = 24.

2. Combination (choose) : This is the number of subsets that can be made from a larger set. It's represented as C(n, k), nCk or often as the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

   The formula for combination is: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]

   - =n!= again is the factorial of n.
   - =k!= is the factorial of k. It corrects for the fact that within the k, the order doesn't matter (unlike permutation).
   - =(n-k)!= is the factorial of the remaining items. This also corrects for the order of the remaining items not mattering.

        For example, for selecting 3 letters from A, B, C, D: C(4,3) = 4.

In permutations, the order is important which means "ABC" is different from "CBA". But in combinations, "ABC" is the same as "CBA" because order doesnâ€™t matter.


*** I think you undersoot me wrong. I know the formulas, but I do not see why they were written this way. Explain it.


Sure, let's dissect these formulas to further understand why they are defined the way they are.

1. Permutation: P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!

   In permutations you take "k" distinct items out of a larger set of "n". When you go to choose the first item, you have "n" options. However, when you go to choose the second item, you've already used one, so you have "n-1" options. The trend continues, providing "n-2" options for the third choice, etc., up to the kth choice, which leaves you "n-k+1" options.

   So without considering the denominator, you get n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-k+1), which is a part of n!. And n! extends further as n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1. However, we're only interested in the first k items, we divide n! by the factorial of the remaining n-k item, i.e., (n-k)!.

2. Combination (choose): C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]

   The idea behind the combination formula is that we're counting subsets, and thus the order of selection doesn't matter - choosing A then B is the same as choosing B then A.

   So, why divide by k! here? That's to adjust for the number of ways we could arrange k items within themselves (as we're interested in subsets, not ordering).

   In other words, because we don't care about the order, when using the permutation formula, we end up with many sets of items that are identical for our purposes (A, B, C) is the same subset as (C, B, A) for example. There are k! ways to arrange k items, so we divide by k! to correct the over-counting.

   The (n-k)! in the denominator relates to adjusting the total permutation (n!) as explained in the permutation part above.

   In summary, these formulas use factorials to first count all possible arrangements, then make adjustments so we're only counting unique subsets or unique orders as needed.
